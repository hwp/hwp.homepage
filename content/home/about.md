# Biography

I am a research assistant at [Idiap Research Institute](https://idiap.ch) in Martigny, Switzerland.
I am also enrolled in the EDEE doctoral program at [EPFL](https://epfl.ch).
My supervisors are [Dr. Jean-Marc Odobez](https://idiap.ch/~odobez) and [Dr. Petr Motlicek](http://people.idiap.ch/pmotlic).

My research explores multi-microphone acoustic signal processing in complicated environments with deep learning methods.
